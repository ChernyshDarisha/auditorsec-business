- **Performance Baseline**: Collect quantitative data on key metrics
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Gather qualitative insights on pain points
- **System Analysis**: Review technology capabilities and limitations

**Example Current State Findings**:
*"Current customer onboarding takes average 14 days with 6 manual handoffs. Customer satisfaction score: 3.2/5.0. 30% of customers require support calls during onboarding. Main pain points: unclear communication, redundant data entry, delayed account activation."*

### **2.2 Future State Vision**
**Objective**: Define the target state and desired outcomes

**Vision Development Process**:
- **Stakeholder Workshops**: Collaborative future state design sessions
- **Best Practice Research**: Industry benchmarking and standard analysis
- **Technology Assessment**: Evaluate enabling technologies and capabilities
- **Performance Targets**: Set specific, measurable improvement goals

**Example Future State Vision**:
*"Streamlined 5-day onboarding with automated workflows, single data entry, and proactive communication. Target: Customer satisfaction 4.5/5.0, 90% self-service completion, zero support calls during onboarding."*

### **2.3 Gap Identification & Prioritization**
**Objective**: Systematically identify and prioritize improvement opportunities

**Gap Categories**:
- **Process Gaps**: Inefficient workflows, manual processes, unclear responsibilities
- **Technology Gaps**: System limitations, integration issues, automation opportunities
- **Skills Gaps**: Training needs, competency deficits, knowledge management
- **Resource Gaps**: Staffing levels, tools, infrastructure requirements

**Prioritization Matrix**:
```
GAP AREA              | IMPACT | EFFORT | PRIORITY | ROOT CAUSE
Manual data entry     | High   | Low    | P1       | Legacy system limitations
Unclear handoffs      | High   | Medium | P1       | Process documentation gaps
Training deficits     | Medium | Medium | P2       | Inadequate onboarding program
System integration   | High   | High   | P2       | Technical debt
```
