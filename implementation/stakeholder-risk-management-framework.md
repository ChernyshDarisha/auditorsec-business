# Comprehensive Stakeholder Management & Risk Assessment Framework

## **Executive Summary**

This framework provides a systematic approach to managing stakeholders and assessing risks for major organizational initiatives. It integrates four core components: stakeholder influence mapping, selection criteria evaluation, comprehensive risk assessment, and early warning indicators to ensure successful project execution and strategic decision-making.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate risks before they become critical issues
- **Strategic Stakeholder Engagement**: Optimize resource allocation and communication strategies
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Objective evaluation criteria for strategic choices
- **Early Problem Detection**: Warning systems to enable rapid response and course correction
